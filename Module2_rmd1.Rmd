# This a level 1 header

## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a link to [Google](http://www.google.com)

Here is a word in **bold** and a word in __bold__.

Here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_ too.

When we compile our document we are using the `R Markdown` package.
Here are some example R commands:

```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```

Here is an example of a non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
    - drink
        + apple juice
* Lunch
    - taco
* Dinner
    - baked chicken
    - broccoli
    - rice

Here is an example of a numbered list:

1. Breakfast
    a. food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        iii. bacon
    b. drink
        i. apple juice
2. Lunch
    a. taco
3. Dinner
    a. baked chicken
    b. broccoli
    c. rice
    
Here is an example of a blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 2. Second item.

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> > This text is nested

Here is an example of code in a blockquote:

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Ahora vamos a probar git a ver qué tal.

Ahora ahremos el push desde aquí.
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

## Insert Tables

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption="Top Six Rows of Cars Dataset")
```

## Insert Equation

$$ Y=\beta_0+\beta_1x $$

## Images

Here is an image inserted

## Insert an Animated gif and a Video

![sunstar](images/sunstar.gif)

![sunstar](images/sunstar.mp4)

## Footnotes

Here is a footnote reference [^1] and we can add another [^longfootnote]

Now let's try inline note. Here is an inline footnote ^[inline notes are easier to write]

[^1]: here is the footnote
[^longfootnote]: here is the long one
